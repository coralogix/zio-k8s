This section gives an overview of the `zio-k8s-client`.

- [Getting started](gettingstarted.md) - helps with setting up the dependencies and connecting to the _Kubernetes_  **API**
- [Working with resources](resources.md) - learn how to perform operations on any _Kubernetes_ **resource**, and how to work with the _Kubernetes_ data types.
- [Generic code](generic.md) - shows how to write generic code that works on any resource with a given set of **capabilities**
- [Testing](testing.md) - describes how to create mocked Kubernetes clients for using in **tests**

Working with deeply nested hierarchies of _Kubernetes_ data can be more convenient by using one of the existing **optics libraries** `zio-k8s` has support for:
- [ZIO Optics](ziooptics.md) - shows how to work with the [ZIO Optics library](https://zio.github.io/zio-optics/)
- [Quicklens](quicklens.md) - shows how to work with the [Quicklens library](https://github.com/softwaremill/quicklens)
- [Monocle](monocle.md) - shows how to work with the [Monocle library](https://www.optics.dev/Monocle/)
